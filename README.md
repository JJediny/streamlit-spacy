## streamlit-spacy

Based on [https://gist.github.com/ines/b320cb8441b590eedf19137599ce6685](https://gist.github.com/ines/b320cb8441b590eedf19137599ce6685)

Thanks [Ines](https://ines.io)

It is a really nice demo for using [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) to build a pretty advanced UI for [spaCy](https://spacy.io) with minimal effort.

### Installation
It is assumed that some `virtualenv` for this Python based project is set up.

```
$ ./install.sh
```
Installs the required libraries and modules.

### Running it
```
$ streamlit run streamlit_spacy.py
```
.. and have fun!
