## streamlit-spacy

Based on [https://gist.github.com/ines/b320cb8441b590eedf19137599ce6685](https://gist.github.com/ines/b320cb8441b590eedf19137599ce6685)

It is a really nice demo for using [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io) to build a pretty advanced UI for [spaCy](https://spacy.io) with minimal effort.

Thanks [Ines](https://ines.io), and thanks to the team at [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io)!

```
$ ./install.sh
```
Installs the required libraries and modules.

### Running it
